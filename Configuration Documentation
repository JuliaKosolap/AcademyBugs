2. Download the project with all dependencies from GitHub: https://github.com/JuliaKosolap/AcademyBugs
3. Open terminal and run the following command:
docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --shm-size=2g selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141.59-20210607
(Selenium Standalone server will run on http://localhost:4444/)
4. In terminal go the directory where test project was saved
5. Run the following command: mvn clean test
(If you open you will see that Chrome session was started)
